This week we took break from the flag project and started to learn about data science, we specificly started talking about quantitative and categorical data during the first lesson so we could be able to properly organize data. After the first lesson I found out this was not the only reason we learned about these two diferent types of data because on our second lesson Mr. Allatta was talking about how functions can be seperated into quantitative and categorical data. During our third lesson we were practicing making data tables, pie charts, and bar charts and on our fourth lesson we were looking at a data table on pyret with information from a spreadsheet.
