This week we started to really go into the flag project and I didn't have a problem creating simple shapes but I did have a problem getting the shapes into the position I wanted them in. Eventually on wednesday my teacher Mr. Allatta told me about a rotation function that worked when the shape was by itself but when I tried to make it overlap another shape it went back to it's orignal position and once I figure that out I'll be able to finish the project.
