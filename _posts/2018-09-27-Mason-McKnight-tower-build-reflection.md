So this is my second post. It will be about my first AP class, which is AP Computer Science. It was kind of embarrassed only because I was in the wrong class and it took me a while to realize. But from what I could tell this class had the same activity as my actual class or at least something similar.In this activity you and your partner had to use five flash card as support beams and after you're done you were suppose to stack textbooks on top of the cards and keep stacking until the cards can't support the weight. I liked this activity mainly becuse it showed me that even though I don't like working in large groups I can still work with at least one person
